Welcome to phuego's documentation!
==================================

**phuEGO** is a network-based method to reconstruct active signalling
pathways from phosphoproteomics datasets. It combines three-layer
network propagation with ego network decomposition to provide small
networks comprising active functional signalling modules. phuEGO boosts
the signal-to-noise ratio from global phosphoproteomics datasets,
enriches the resulting networks for functional phosphosites and allows
the improved comparison and integration across datasets.

The Python package offers a command line interface (CLI) that implement 
the methods. To run phuEGO, the user can either directly calls the
`CLI <#2-using-the-cli>`__ application from command line, or integrate
the `python functions <#3-using-the-python-package>`__ into their own
script. We recommend the user to use the CLI and submit jobs to a server
where possible, to ensure robust execution of the tasks.

       abstract = {Signalling networks are critical for virtually all cell functions. Our current knowledge of cell signalling has been summarised in signalling pathway databases, which, while useful, are highly biassed towards well-studied processes, and donâ€™t capture context specific network wiring or pathway cross-talk. Mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics data can provide a more unbiased view of active cell signalling processes in a given context, however, it suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio and poor reproducibility across experiments. Methods to extract active signalling signatures from such data struggle to produce unbiased and interpretable networks that can be used for hypothesis generation and designing downstream experiments. Here we present phuEGO, which combines three-layer network propagation with ego network decomposition to provide small networks comprising active functional signalling modules. PhuEGO boosts the signal-to-noise ratio from global phosphoproteomics datasets, enriches the resulting networks for functional phosphosites and allows the improved comparison and integration across datasets. We applied phuEGO to five phosphoproteomics data sets from cell lines collected upon infection with SARS CoV2. PhuEGO was better able to identify common active functions across datasets and to point to a subnetwork enriched for known COVID-19 targets. Overall, phuEGO provides a tool to the community for the improved functional interpretation of global phosphoproteomics datasets.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
